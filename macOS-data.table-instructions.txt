Instructions for running main.r on macOS; need to be completed BEFORE running library(data.table) EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE FILE...

 1. Go to https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/ and determine which LLVM build matches your architecture and version of macOS.
 2. Open terminal and run the following commands...

curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/openmp-<matching version>-Release.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz openmp-<matching version>-Release.tar.gz -C /

    Note: You might be asked to enter your password before the second command executes.
 3. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html and download the binaries for data.table that match your system's architecture.
 4. Run the following command...

PKG_CPPFLAGS='-Xclang -fopenmp' PKG_LIBS=-lomp R CMD INSTALL /path/to/downloaded/binaries/data.table_<version>.tar

Once these steps are followed, you should be able to run library(data.table) in main.r without any errors about OpenMP.
